Demo program in C++ for insertion sorting using OOP concepts and paradigms.

OOPsorting.cpp is the main demo and uses an individually defined class to enter and sort an array with user-generated contents
of user-chosen lenght.

Randomarraysort.cpp fulfils the same tasks but with a pseudo-randomly generated array of user-defined lenght.

Classarray.h contains the class definition for the class used by OOPsorting.cpp.

Stools.h contains the function definitions to check if an array is sorted is ascending/descending order and definitions to round a given
floating point integer.
Stools2.h contains the same function definitions as Stools.h but templates are issued for the datatype of the first arguments (array)
of the functions that check sorting status.
